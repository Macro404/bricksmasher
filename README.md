# Bricksmasher
 Bricksmasher is a clone of the popular game Breakout. The player controls a platform at the bottom of the screen and
 tries to direct a ball to destroy blocks at the top of the screen. If the ball reaches the bottom of the screen without
 the player catching it, a life is lost.

Installation:

Bricksmasher is built using the libGDX framework. This is a gradle project.
