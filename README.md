# Bricksmasher
 Bricksmasher is a clone of the popular game Breakout. The player controls a platform at the bottom of the screen and
 tries to direct a ball to destroy the blocks at the top of the screen by hitting them. When doing this the player scores points. 
 If the ball reaches the bottom of the screen without the player catching it, the player loses the game. 
 The player wins the game when able to clear all blocks on the 5 created levels without failing to catch the ball.
